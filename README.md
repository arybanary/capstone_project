The data (tweets) are provided.

The implementation consists of a Juypter notebook and a training file train.py. To recreate the model trainig, access to Amazon SageMaker is required. The training and the deployment of the model were performed on Amazon SageMaker. In order to run the implementation, the best approach is creating a new Notebook Instance on Amazon SageMaker and take this repository as source.

For the preprocessing the following libraries are needed:
- pandas
- sklearn
- nltk
